## What the heck is Bandit?

Bandit is a dead simple A/B testing (statistical hypothesis) Javascript library. Bandit's goal is to make A/B testing more accessible for developers looking to put together Javascript applications quickly.

There are currently 3 different kinds of testing types Bandit supports, normal A/B tests, multivariate tests & dependent A/B tests.

Bandit is primarily configuaration driven, your tests are all derived from a JSON configuration you provide when instanciating your tests.
