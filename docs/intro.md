## What the heck is Bandit?

Bandit is a dead simple A/B testing (statistical hypothesis) Javascript library. Bandit's goal is to make A/B testing more accessible for application writers.

There are currently 3 different kinds of testing types Bandit supports, normal, multivariate & dependent A/B tests.

Bandit is primarily configuaration driven, your A/B are all derived from a JSON configuration you provide when instanciating Bandit.
